# Challenge 2 : Schedule recurring updates and manage dynamic scope

Azure Update Manager allows you to create and save recurring deployment schedules, set on a daily, weekly, or hourly basis. You can specify the machines to be updated and the updates to be installed as part of these schedules. The set schedule autonomously handles the installation of updates for individual VMs as well as on a larger scale.


## **Goal**

The goal of this challenge is to  Learn how to use Azure Update Manager to schedule recurring updates on your machines and manage dynamic scope for recurring updates.

## Actions
Please perform these tasks to complete challenge 2: 

### Task 1: Schedule recurring updates on a single VM

Update Manager enables you to inspect your machines for the latest updates whenever needed, on-demand. You can observe the recent update status and respond accordingly. Verify if an update is available for one of your Azure VM. 

### Task 2: add tags to VMs

Update Manager enables you to inspect your machines for the latest updates whenever needed, on-demand. You can observe the recent update status and respond accordingly. Verify if an update is available for one of your Arc-enabled server.

### Task 3: Manage dynamic scope

Periodic assessment is a feature enabling automatic update checks by Update Manager. Activating this on your machines allows for daily update retrievals and viewing of the current compliance status of your machines. Use the update setting to perform periodic assessment on a subset of your machines.
